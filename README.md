TODO BEFORE SUBMITTING
- Editing tasks/ deleting?
- Persistence when you log back in the table and tasks need to be there - use cookies and an id to do this or a custom url like when2meet
- Details and members assigned are not being handled
- Clicking on the task does not show the details
- Tasks are not saved to the server (no persistence)
- Reloading the page after creating a task creates an error - MAKE SURE YOU FIX persistence
- URL persistence not done yet
